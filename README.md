# Grade Book Project

Implement the missing functionality in GradeBook.java that will load grade details from a file (grades.txt) and populate the 'students' array with Student objects. The first line of the file will contain the number of students and each following line of the file will contain a first name, a last name, and a grade separated by commas. For example, the following would be the contents of a file with the sample data from homework #8:

    2
    Alan,Turing,95
    Ada,Lovelace,87
